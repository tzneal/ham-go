# Ham related go code

## cmd/termlog

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzneal/ham-go/master/_screenshots/screenshot.png)

The main driver for writing the rest of this code.  A cross platform console
based ham contact logger.  I'm developing it for my own use, so it only has
features I need/want.

- Saves logs as ADIF files with custom fields
- Supports auto-commiting log filesgit to a git repository
- DX cluster & POTA spot monitoring
- Radio control through hamlib (github.com/dh1tw/goHamlib)
- Logs for both WSJT-X and fldigi
- LoTW integration (syncs QSL information from LoTW to stored ADIF files)

## Installation

```
go install github.com/tzneal/ham-go/cmd/termlog
```

Precompiled binaries are also available at https://github.com/tzneal/ham-go/releases

## Configuration

1) Run termlog once, then hit Ctrl+Q to quit.  This will create an initial
   config file at ~/.termlog.toml that you can then modify.
2) Fill out the operator section at a minimum

## Custom Commands

Custom user commands can be reached through ```Ctrl+E```. These command are defined in the configuration file and environment
variables are used to pass state to the command line.

As an exanple, the following will construct a command that syncs the current ADIF log file with LoTW using tqsl.

```toml
  [[Operator.Commands]]
    Name = "Sync Current Logfile with LoTW"
    Command = "$TQSL -a compliant --nodate --upload --batch $LOGFILE"
```

Environment Variables
- LOGFILE - Path to the current logfile
- TQSL - Path to the tqsl binary configured in the configuration file

### Custom Fields
In the configuration file, custom ADIF fields can be defined.  A SOTA field is defined in the default 
configuration and can be removed if not needed.

```
  [[Operator.CustomFields]]
    Name = "sota_ref"
    Label = "SOTA"
    Width = 8
    Default = ""
```

# Command line options
```
Usage of ./termlog:
  -color-test
    	display a color test
  -config string
    	path to the configuration file (default "~/.termlog.toml")
  -hamlib-list
    	list the supported libhamlib devices
  -index
    	index the ADIF files passed in on the command line
  -key-test
    	list keyboard events
  -log string
    	specify a log file to load and write to
  -no-net
    	disable all features that require network access (useful for POTA/SOTA)
  -no-rig
    	disable rig control, even if enabled in the config file
  -search string
    	search the indexed ADIF files and print the results
  -sync-lotw-qsl
    	fetches QSL information from LoTW to update log QSL information in the default log directory
  -upgrade-config
    	upgrade the configuration file to the latest format
```

## adif

ADIF parsing and writing

## callsigns

Callsign lookup interface with a couple of supported backends.

## db

ADIF indexer used to quickly identify when you last saw a contact and how many
times you've logged him.

## dxcc

Callsign lookup via prefixes/exceptions through the data at
www.country-files.com (works offline).

## dxcluster

The beginnings of a DXCluster client.

## fldigi

Enough code to parse the realtime fldigi emitted logs and save them to termlog.

## wsjtx

Enough code to parse the realtime WSJT-X emitted logs and save them to termlog. I use this when running
FT8 to capture logs in real time from WSJT-X.
